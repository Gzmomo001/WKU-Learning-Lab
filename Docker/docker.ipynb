    "Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers package an application with all its dependencies, ensuring it runs consistently across different environments. Key features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```Containerization```: Isolated application environments\n",
    "- ```Portability```: Runs consistently across different systems\n",
    "- ```Efficiency```: Lightweight compared to virtual machines\n",
    "- ```Isolation```: Separate filesystem, networking, and process space\n",
    "\n",
    "Main components:\n",
    "- Docker Engine (core runtime)\n",
    "- Docker Images (application templates)\n",
    "- Docker Hub (image repository)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get started\n",
    "Follow the [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) to get started.\n",
    ">[!NOTE]\n",
    "When modifying ```greeting``` on the ```todo container```, the path should be 'usr/local/src/app/routes/getGreeting.js'\n",

    "## Build your own image\n",
    "Resource: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/build-and-push-first-image/\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install vs code plugin: Docker\n",
    "2. open getting started todo app folder\n",
    "3. right click on the Dockerfile and select build image\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dockerfile\n",
    "Some of the most common instructions in a Dockerfile include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```FROM \\<image>``` - this specifies the base image that the build will extend.\n",
    "- WORKDIR \\<path> - this instruction specifies the \"working directory\" or the path in the image where files will be copied and commands will be executed.\n",
    "- COPY \\<host-path> \\<image-path> - this instruction tells the builder to copy files from the host and put them into the container image.\n",
    "- RUN \\<command> - this instruction tells the builder to run the specified command.\n",
    "- ENV \\<name> \\<value> - this instruction sets an environment variable that a running container will use.\n",
    "- EXPOSE \\<port-number> - this instruction sets configuration on the image that indicates a port the image would like to expose.\n",
    "- USER \\<user-or-uid> - this instruction sets the default user for all subsequent instructions.\n",
    "- CMD [\"\\<command>\", \"\\<arg1>\"] - this instruction sets the default command a container using this image will run.\n"
